``` r
merged_data <- nhanes_accel %>%
  inner_join(nhanes_covar, by = "seqn")
```

## Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each education category

``` r
merged_data %>%
  group_by(sex, education) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = count, values_fill = 0) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| education              | Male | Female |
|:-----------------------|-----:|-------:|
| Less than high school  |   27 |     28 |
| High school equivalent |   35 |     23 |
| More than high school  |   56 |     59 |

Comments: This table shows that both men and women in the dataset tend
to have higher education levels, with the “More than high school” group
having the highest representation for both genders. However, men are
more prevalent in the “High school equivalent” category, while the “Less
than high school” group shows an almost equal gender distribution.

## Create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category

``` r
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Age Distributions by Sex and Education Level",
    x = "Education Level",
    y = "Age",
    fill = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Comments: Participants with less education tend to be older, with the
“less than high school” group having the oldest participants on average.
In contrast, the “more than high school” group includes younger
participants.

In High School Equivalent,women in this group tend to be slightly older
than men, with a median age closer to 60 for women and around 55 for
men.Most women are of similar ages (closer to the median), while men
show more variability.

In More than High school, it shows the most diverse age distribution for
both men and women. It suggests that people with more than a high school
education come from a broad range of age groups.The median age for both
men and women is around 41 years, indicating that the central tendency
is similar for both genders in this education level.

## Aggregate and create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis)

``` r
activity_age_plot <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(total_activity = rowSums(across(min1:min1440), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(.~ education) +
  labs(
    title = "Total Activity By Age and Education Level and Sex",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total Activity (MIMS)",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

print(activity_age_plot)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

Comment: All groups show a decline in activity with age, participants
with higher education maintain higher levels of activity into older age.
In the “Less than high school” group, physical activity decreases with
age for both men and women, particularly after age 60. In the “High
school equivalent” group, middle age women generally have higher
activity than middle age men. Activity decreases for women and men after
age 40. In the “More than high school” group, activity trends are
relatively stable across age, with men and women displaying similar
activity patterns throughout the lifespan. However, women tend to have
slightly higher activity levels than men overall. After the age of 60,
both men and women experience a gradual decrease in total activity. The
decline is more gradual compared to those with lower education levels.
